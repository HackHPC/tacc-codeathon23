The MS-CC is following the events code of conduct that Internet2 requires at its events. Internet2 and the community are committed to promoting a positive environment at our events and conferences for our members and the research and education community. Our community values fair and equitable treatment of all individuals and expects our attendees to interact professionally and respectfully towards one another. Discrimination or harassment of any type, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion, is not consistent with our values and will not be tolerated. Unacceptable behavior includes offensive comments; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or unwanted attention; inappropriate physical contact; harassing, derogatory, or demeaning conduct; or other behavior that demonstrates a lack of professionalism or respect for another individual.


Participants are expected to follow these rules at all Internet2-hosted events. Participants violating these rules may be asked to leave an event without warning or a refund, at the discretion of Internet2. In some instances, such behavior may be reported to local or federal law enforcement officers. If you believe that you or someone else has been subject to these behaviors, please contact the Internet2 Ethics Hotline immediately at (877) 842-6829 or send a message via the web at www.reportlineweb.com/internet2.
